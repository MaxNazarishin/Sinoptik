This repository contains an example of a weather site that I created when I first started learning web development. The site is powered by an API.

To run my project, you must first download my file. 
An example of how to download a file: 
1) Click on the "code" button.
2) Select "HTTPS" and copy the link. 
3) Download "git bash" from the official website.
4) Right-click on the place where you want to install my project (desktop, for example).
5) Select "Open Git Bush here".
6) Write "git clone" in the console.
7) After a space after the word "clone", right-click on the console area and select "Paste", the link you copied to the Git hub will be pasted.
8) Press the "Enter" button on the keyboard.
9) Open Visual Studio Code.
10) Paste the folder into Visual Studio Code.
11) Open the file "index.html".
12) Press the "Go Live" button.
